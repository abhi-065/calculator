# Note

1. This calculator works for only **2** numbers. [For example: 22*34, 8675รท684 etc.]

2. You can also enter numbers and mathematical operators through keypress.

3. For now only **10** characters [including numbers and operators] are allowed to enter per one calculation.

4. If you enter more than 10 characters or any key other than numbers and operators, you will get an error message.

5. To remove that error press "AC".

6. The UI is inspired by **iOS calculator application**.
